### What is 'Relay'?

This project allows you to purchase Sonoff relay switches, and flash the ESP8266 chip on the with a custom web server so you can have full control over them.

Relay is the Android/iOS App used to detect the customer web servers you create, and toggle the relay (power to the plugged in devices) on and off remotely.

'Remote' current means you have to be on the local network which these sonoff switches belong to.
